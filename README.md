# Employee-Churn-Prediction-Using-ML

Developed predictive models using machine learning to predict employee churn in an organization

## Steps Taken
- Cleaned and analyzed the data using the Numpy and Pandas library in Python environment
- Utilized the label Encoder function to transform the categorical variables to binary variables and performed the analysis using the Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier
- Performed the experiment on the models after performing feature selection using correlation matrix
- Scaled the dataset using the MinMax scaler and Standard scalar function on both the original data and feature selection
- Performed the same process on the scaled dataset using the same ML models
